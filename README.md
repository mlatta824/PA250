# PA250
history app: We are going to be creating a web application for a PA250 project that will use an innovative technology of NCF tags that users will be able to scan. The NFC tag will have a URL embedded into the tag, and
it bring up a this website that will give people the ability to access information about the history of the PA turnpike. The mascot that is being used is a lightning bug.
